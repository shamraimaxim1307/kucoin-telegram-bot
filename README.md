# kucoin-telegram-bot
I've created my telegram bot version of KuCoin API Bot! <br>
If you want to interact with my bot, you will change data in kucointelegrambot.py, additional/kucoinseller.py and additional/database/models.py (I had created commentaries at the start of code, you could see that)<br>
<b>How to start my bot?</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Run 'kucointelegrambot.py' program and go to the Telegram</li>
  <li>Enter /start</li>
  <li>Choose button "Set API Data"</li>
  <li>Enter API KuCoin Data</li>
  <li>Choose button "Start rolling currency"</li>
</ul>
After that, if you followed instructions bot will start working<br>
But there is one drawback: If you want to cancel an order, cancel it by KuCoin App/Web-Site
